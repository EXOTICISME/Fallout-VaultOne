<h2>Rules:</h2><br>
#1. You are expected to play out the role you have chosen. A scavenger wouldn't rob someone and a Legionnaire isn't a petty raider. If you're unsure of how your profession is expected to be played, play the Fallout games and read on the various Wikis. Your lack of comprehension doesn't constitute a problem for us and may result in a warning or a ban at our staff's discretion.
<br>
#2. If you find yourself banned and wish to appeal, go to the forums and appeal with the correct format. We'll process everyone in due time, and mass DMing or tagging will result in a loss of Discord permissions or removal from Discord. Seriously, don't do it.
<br>
#3. Be nice, don't flame, and remember that players and staff are people too. If you have an issue with a player or conduct in-game, please bring it up to an admin in-game.
<br>
#4. Responding as the same character is a no. If you die, you die, and move on to another character. Failure to "roll with the punches" may result in a warning, and eventually a ban if you don't stop.
<br>
#5. "Meta" knowledge, or using knowledge your character wouldn't readily have available to him is discouraged, and repeated misconduct regarding meta actions will be warned and possibly banned.
<br>
#6. NO KOS, No exceptions. Players need to state intent before attacking, even if it's just saying, "Your going to die Legion" KOS is a BANNABLE offense.
<br>
#7. NO RP evading/fail RP. RP evading is described as, taking actions to deny other players a chance to RP, mostly in a way that engages in hostilities. For example, a legion soldier sees the ncr, and starts running from them so they don't have a chance to say anything. That said, if you're a member of a rival faction, you're expected to stop, and say something, even if it's "DIE" Fail RP can be described as this, or for example, "Player A threatens Player B, then player B immediately kills them."
<br>
#8. Faction members are required to stay in uniform at all times(espionage is allowed)
<br>
#9. Legion is not permitted to use advanced technologies, including weapons and chems, such as lasers and stimpacks.
<br>
#10. We're all here to have fun. Make sure to play a supportive role in everyones roleplay enjoyment.(edited)
<br>
#11. You may not use the same PC and internet as a friend playing at the same point in time.<br>
